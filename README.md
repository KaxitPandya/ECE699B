We can run LLM code using this colab file: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JFqPpI4q2ORFcts-Fe_HDJ5VKuly0UWi?authuser=7#scrollTo=b1xj6P-2nOpt
No need to connect to google drive, it will fetch dataset with the help of API directly


And for ML code:
1. Dowload the csv data in the present github repo named: Data.csv
2. Run the code directly in python on loacal machine
