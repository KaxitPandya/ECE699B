We can run LLM code using this colab file: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JFqPpI4q2ORFcts-Fe_HDJ5VKuly0UWi?authuser=7#scrollTo=b1xj6P-2nOpt
No need to connect to google drive, it will fetch dataset with the help of API directly


And for ML code:
1. Dowload the csv data from here: https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/Thriving-Neighborhoods/Fleet-Preventative-Maintenance-Repair-Work-Orders/2a8x-bxjm/about_data (Click on Export and choose the .csv format)
2. Place it the same folder as code and rename it to: Data.csv
3. Run the code directly in python on local machine with VS code or any editor
